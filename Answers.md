1. What problem does the context API help solve?
***enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application***
1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
***actions - the only way to change the state, an object describing what happened***
***reducers - to specify how the state tree is transformed by actions***
***store - holds all your applications state***
***single source of truth - the state of your whole application is stoed in the object tree within a single store***
1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
***Application state is global, and component state is local***

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
***redux-thunk - stop actions, forward an action untouched, dispatch a different action, dispatch multiple actions***
1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
***Did the sprint using context but I honestly do prefer Redux, redux just makes more sense, and seem easy to understand***
